### v3.0.0 (2016-04-24)

  * Adds a number of new web client API facets:
    - [`dnd`](/lib/clients/web/facets/dnd.js)
    - [`files.comments`](/lib/clients/web/facets/files.comments.js)
    - [`mpim`](/lib/clients/web/facets/mpim.js)
    - [`usergroups`](/lib/clients/web/facets/usergroups.js)
    - [`usergroups.users`](/lib/clients/web/facets/usergroups.users.js)
  * **BREAKING** Changes the function signatures for some facet methods:
    - [`channels.list`](/lib/clients/web/facets/channels.js): `exclude_archived` moves to an `opts` object, instead of being a separate argument
    - [`groups.list`](/lib/clients/web/facets/groups.js): `exclude_archived` moves to an `opts` object, instead of being a separate argument
    - [`chat.delete`](/lib/clients/web/facets/chat.js): The `ts` and `channel` arguments are re-ordered to be alphabetical
    - [`stars.list`](/lib/clients/web/facets/stars.js): `user` moves to an `opts` object, instead of being a separate argument
    - [`users.list`](/lib/clients/web/facets/users.js): `presence` moves to an `opts` object, instead of being a separate argument
  * **BREAKING** Updates the function signature for [`BaseAPIClient.prototype.makeAPICall`](/lib/clients/client.js) to take required API args and optional API args as separate params, from `makeAPICall(endpoint, optData, optCb)` to `makeAPICall(endpoint, apiArgs, apiOptArgs, optCb)`
  * New methods are added to various facets:
    - [`files.revokePublicURL`](/lib/clients/web/facets/files.js)
    - [`files.sharedPublicURL`](/lib/clients/web/facets/files.js)
    - [`team.integrationLogs`](/lib/clients/web/facets/team.js)
    - [`team.integrationLogs`](/lib/clients/web/facets/team.js)

### v2.3.0 (2016-02-28)

  * Caches messages on the RTM client, to improve handling in cases where message send fails
  * Removes the handler for the websocket level `ping` handler (not the RTM API level ping handler)
  * Refactors the logic for handling ws send responses to a single function

### v2.2.1 (2016-03-12)

  * Adds an `im` alias for the `dm` facet to the web client, to match the API endpoint naming

### v2.2.0 (2016-03-12)

  * Adds promise support to the RTM client `send` and `sendMessage` methods
  * Fixes the way message response callbacks work, so that the success case is only called when the websocket receives a message with a `reply_to` matching the id of the dispatched message, instead of when the ws instance signals message send success
  * Fixes the way `getAPICallArgs` works, to correctly pull data out of the `opts` arg

### v2.1.0 (2016-03-05)

 * Adds promises to the Slack clients. If no callback is passed to an API call, a promise will be created and returned instead.
 * Logs a warning if an API response with a `warning` key is received

### v2.0.6 (2016-03-01)

  * Fixes a crash introduce in `2.0.5` if you try and instantiate a `WebClient` without passing in any options

### v2.0.5 (2016-03-01)

  * Updates the way that API requests are throttled to:
    * avoid a condition where the request queue callback could be called multiple times, causing a crash
    * refactor the logic in `_callTransport` into multiple functions to make it easier to follow
  * Updates dev dependencies:
    * eslint
    * nock
    * eslint-config-airbnb

### v2.0.4 (2016-02-28)

  * Passes through the logLevel param to the getLogger function

### v2.0.3 (2016-02-28)

  * The RTM `AUTHENTICATED` event now also emits the `rtm.start` payload
  * Fixes the way that loggers are instantiated and used, so that the JSDoc for `opts.logger` is correct

### v2.0.2 (2016-02-15)

  * Adds coveralls to the repo, to track code coverage and display a badge in the README
  * Updates the disconnect function on the RTM client to support both an error message and a code or reason for the disconnect, e.g. `account_inactive`
  * Updates the message-handlers for `team_xxx` events to set the team back to the data-store once changes are made

### v2.0.1 (2016-02-13)

  * Updates to `ws@1.0.1`
  * Fixes a bad variable name in [`example-web-client`](/examples/example-web-client.js)

### v2.0.0 (2016-02-13)

  Refactors the library to javascript, adds a lot of tests and restructures it to improve maintainability and extend functionality.
  * Creates two separate clients:
    - RTM; manages connection to Slack's RTM API, including reconnects
    - Web; provideas a callback interface to all of Slack's Web API endpoints
  * Moves the memory data store implementation off the clients and into its own class
  * Uncouples the model objects from the clients; model functions to send messages to channels etc are now accessed via the web and RTM client
  * Moves the transport layer (websockets and HTTP) to a pluggable model, so that complex transports (through request proxies etc) can be handled
  * Adds test coverage on most core functionality in the library
